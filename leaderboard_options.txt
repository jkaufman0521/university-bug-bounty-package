This document will provide you with a option that could be implemented for the leaderboard for your college/university's bug bounty program. This leaderboard option was found using a google search and is not directly a part of this package. This is only a recommendation of an easy to use leaderboard. Feel free to choose a different one or develop one.

The leaderboard option presented here is https://keepthescore.co which provides an easy to use leaderboard. In order to have more than 6 players, it requires a one-time payment of $5.99 to use for up to 500 players.

Again, this is an option but is not directly a part of this package nor created by the creator of this package.
