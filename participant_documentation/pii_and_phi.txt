Please read this documentation to ensure you understand what PII and PHI is. This is an important topic to understand as as you test for vulnerabilities is important that you look out for this type of information.

PII stands for personally identifiable information. This type of data is information that by itself could know who the person is. This information includes name, address, phone number, social security number, and bank account information. This is not an all inclusive list and there is much more that falls under PII. Because of the grave damage that it could cause, it is critical that this data remains secure at all times. That is why there are special regulations that apply to this type of data. Within the realm of colleges and universities the main law that protects this data is FERPA.

PHI is another type of especially sensitive data and stands for protected health information. This type of data includes any information that is in an individuals health record. This would include information such as name, address, allergies, surgeries, disabilities, and past medical information. This is not an all inclusive list and includes a lot more. The same applies to PHI as it did with PII in that there are additional regulations that apply to this data. The main law that protects this data is HIPPA, which applies to all healthcare providers.

Please ensure to check with your program to find out the policies regarding this type of information. Most programs most likely will not allow you to look for this data, but will want you to report it immediately and want you to stop what you are doing if you come across either of these types of data.
